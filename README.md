# Health Insurance Cross Sell Prediction üè† üè•

## Project Intro/Objective
Predict Health Insurance Owners' who will be interested in Vehicle Insurance. (Describe the main goals of the project and potential civic impact. Limit to a short paragraph, 3-6 Sentences)

### Methods Used
* Inferential Statistics
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling
* etc.

### Technologies
* Python
*  MySql
* Pandas, jupyter
* etc. 

## Project Description

1)Our client is an Insurance company that has provided Health Insurance to its customers now they need your help in building a model to predict whether the policyholders (customers) from past year will also be interested in Vehicle Insurance provided by the company

2)EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) was performed on data to analyse the hidden pattern of data.
  a)For example to find the distributions of data PDF's  are used
  b)For outlier detection - Boxplot
  
3)Stastical Analysis used to replace the missing values of the data

4)Feature selection techniques are applied on data to improve the accuracy

5)Data balancing techniques used to balance the highly imbalanced data

6)Data modelling has done by using supervised machine learning techniques like logistic regression,decision tree,knn etc.,

7)Accuracy of the model improved by hyperparameter tuning techniques like gridsearch.
  
## Needs of this project

- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning
- statistical modeling
- writeup/reporting
- etc. (be as specific as possible)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](Repo folder containing raw data) within this repo.

    *If using offline data mention that and how they may obtain the data from the froup)*
    
3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](Repo folder containing data processing scripts/notebooks)
4. etc...

*If your project is well underway and setup is fairly complicated (ie. requires installation of many packages) create another "setup.md" file and link to it here*  

5. Follow setup [instructions](Link to file)
